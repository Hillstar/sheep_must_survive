2D Pixel-Art Firearms Pack

[ some technical advices for the Unity editor ]

I recommend using the following sprite settings:
	0. Texture type: Sprite (2D & UI); // Obviously.
	1. Filter Mode: Point (no filter); // Bilinear&Trilinear filter will kill the pixel art style.
	2. Compression: None; // Use compression at your own risk.
	3. Full-rect // You might want to change it for perfomance/optimization.

You will probably need to change the following sprite settings:
	4. Pixels Per Unit: 8 // Kindly change this value to fit your own project.

I intentionally leave at least 2 pixels from the image's left border to use it for firing/recoil animation!

The handle / pistol grip location is unified for each and every firearm of this pack!

ENJOY & be happy !! =)

Warm regards,
